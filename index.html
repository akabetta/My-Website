            <h2>Hello</h2>
            <p class="intro">
                I'm studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Marmara University. I'm a social person who is constantly curious, researching, able to analyze,
                compatible with teamwork, analytical thinking. I'm improving myself in digital-analog communication, software, cyber security and mobile communication
                techniques. I also develop software projects by learning advanced programming languages. I want to be an engineer who specializes in these
                fields and produces innovative and effective solutions, and I want to take part in projects at international level.

                <h3>Python</h3>
                <p>
                    I effectively use many libraries of the Python programming language. I have knowledge in NumPy and OpenCV libraries, especially since I participate
                    in UAV competitions. Also on Back-End, I know about frameworks like Flask and Django. I have projects on my GitHub page.
